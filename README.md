# Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO)

This project based on the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965997815000113) and contains an implementation of the Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO), inspired by the hunting mechanism of antlions. ALO is a metaheuristic optimization method that mimics the interaction between ants and antlions in nature to solve optimization problems.


## Main components:
- **Agent Class** - Implements the properties and methods associated with the behavior of individual agents (ants).

- **Algorithm Class** - Implements the core mechanics of the Ant Lion Optimizer.

- **Benchmark File** - Provides a set of standard test functions to evaluate the algorithm's performance.


## Getting Started 
To run this project, you need to install the required dependencies. You can install them using pip:
